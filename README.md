# fpt-flood
So, I made this to see if I could make a FTP-Flooder, i tried a few things with this listed below -

1. FTP Flood - Creating and closing a bunch of connections over and over.

2. FTP Slowloris - So, essentially like a slowloris attack, i tried to force max connections and make it unresponsive // make it so no one could connect.

3. Login Flood - Making it login with random credits and hoping it would use enough resources and crash.

Nothing worked ;(
